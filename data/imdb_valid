0 probably one of the worst movies ever made , i 'm still trying to figure if it was meant to be fun , but for sure i had no fun at all . maybe the movie lost something during the english - italian translation , dunno , for sure i miss the guts to watch it again in original version.<br /><br />my rate for it 2/10 , and i feel like i 'm being pretty generous ( let 's say 1 point is for liv cause she 's a nice babe , and the other point is for those decent actors that got trapped into a worthless , useless and pathetic movie)<br /><br />take care < br /><br />alex
1 i liked this movie . many people refer to it as " sabrina the teenage feminist " . they do that with a lot of movies that melissa joan hart is in . still , she really surprised me in this movie because she was great in the part of mary , who fights for justice when her roommate is raped . you could tell that hart was extremely determined in this movie and it showed . i also liked lisa dean ryan as mary 's roommate . she was very effective in making me feel sorry for her character after she was raped . josh hopkins was good as the cocky and egotistical rapist . lochlyn munro convincingly played his character . the acting in this movie is better than in most tv movies , in my opinion.<br /><br />the movie was pretty predictable though . also , i expected more from the ending , it was too abrupt . the delivery could have been better . but the performances and overall plot make up for these problems .
0 makes " invasion usa " look like " apocalypse now " . this one can only be recommended to us skinheads , john birch supporters or militia members . the message is very simple : let 's shoot them all - gooks , commies , latinos , everything that is n't american.<br /><br />besides , this is badly acted , badly scripted , badly interpreted , incredibly stupid but no fun at all . this movie could be used as a toorture device by cia torturers . oops , sorry , there ca n't be any us torturers because they are the good
0 hollywood movie industry is the laziest one in the entire world . it only needs a single hit to flood theaters with the same old crap re - invented over and over again . take superheroes for example , for each x - man and spiderman , there are daredevil , elektra , ghost rider and hulk . japanese horror remakes are even worst . it only took the ring , which was pitch - perfect ( mostly because of mr. gore verbinsky ) , to bring a ton of look - alike creepy - woman based horrors , e.g. the ring 2 , the eye , dark water ( which was fine , but pointless ) , and the grudges.<br /><br />the first grudge was n't entirely bad . it was scary most of the way , which is what one could expect from it . plus , the plot had some brains mixing narratives . grudge 2 is exactly like the previous ; this could be a good thing , but hey , what boy men in black ii ? was it a nice thing to xerox the entire screenplay and just change the villain ? for the grudge 2 , the critic goes the same way.<br /><br />tired scares , bad acting ( except for amber tamblyn ) , and clich√©s all over the place . three stories take place , on different places and time . there is aubrey ( tamblyn ) investigating what drove her sister karen ( sarah michelle gellar ) to death ; allison ( arielle kebbel ) who is taken by colleagues to visit the house where the incident depicted in the first movie took place ; and finally , an american family that witness strange stuff happening on the apartment next door . glad to say ( and i mean it ) that everything is tied up at the end , but one must not rely on the end to make a good picture , when everything else is simply tiresome and dull.<br /><br />the chills are all over there , a girl alone in the lockers , someone who should n't enter a house , others that dig too deep . meanwhile , ghosts keep killing and killing and killing , which seems even more deadlier than ten world wars or the ebola epidemic . hey , does n't that seem just like another bad japanese remake , something called pulse ? yeah , day after day it 's getting easier to hold a grudge ... against hollywood bullshits .
0 i thought sleeper cell was interesting , and exciting to watch , up until the last episode , when nothing happens , its f * * * * * * bs , you americans portray muslims as terrorists , and the americans as hero 's , its the other way around , i hate it when every american tv show ends up predictable , i was hoping the bombs would go off in that stadium , but i knew it would'nt , it takes the joy out of watching it when you know that the good guys are going to save the day , yet again , americans are the biggest terrorists , g bush the leader of them all , he is to blame for 9/11 , and i 'm p * * * * * off that you keep throwing these shows at us , which are all the f * * * * * * same ! i 've a good show about terrorism , its called " the whitehorse " and bush himself the cell leader , its the same with 24 , how ever 24 was good , sleeper cell is a mock and should never make a season 2 , its f * * * * * joke ! and so are you american producers .
1 i am new at this , so bear with me please . i am a big fan of surface . i thought the script and the computer graphics were exceptional , as good as any sci fi flick i 've seen at the theater . in february the tv guide said season finale , the announcer for the show said something to the effect of , " ... and now for the season finale of surface . " season finale , not series finale ! i could n't wait for fall to get here , to see was going to happen next . so fall gets here and it 's nowhere to be found ! if nbc is n't going to pick it up , what about sci fi or usa ? it seems to me that bay watch did n't last long on abc & then usa picked it up , and it went gang busters ! ( i bet abc was chocking ) ha ! if not a series , then at least a mini series , to give all us loyal fans closure . what happened to our guy 's trapped in the church steeple ? was the creature in the chaple nim ? did he have a grouth spert ? does the cloned guy come over to our side ? there are so many unanswered questions . thank 's for listening to me babble !
0 whoa!terrible , terrible , terrible , terrible , did i mention terrible?you can tell just by the dvd cover not to get this movie , but unfortunately that was n't the case for me . well , someone brought this home for me to watch , and when i looked at it i just wanted to strangle the person , because they used my money . i will certainly be taking it back soon , but i might as well tell you about it while i have it in memory , for i definitely want to forget it . this movie does n't deserve to even be called horrible . it 's beyond horrible . quite possibly , the worst film ever . the acting was so , so , so , so horrifically disgusting , as well as the deaths being so entirely lame and predictable . i did n't even laugh at how bad this movie was , which kind of frightens me a little . don't see this film , shame on you if you 're even looking at this movie page , and i have extreme pity for you if you 're looking at this movie page , because you think this will be decent.final word : yuck ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
1 actually , i have more a question , than a comment . i loved z - boys , and the lords of dogtown . saw lords first , then the doc , and while i loved the story , i am curious as to why in the movie , sid was an important character , but in the documentary , he was n't part of the team , and only merely mentioned as just some kid they knew . does anyone know the story on that ? the story of these boys was amazing . i never experienced the skateboarding craze where i grew up , but my kids have enjoyed it . what i have seen in local skate parks is what these boys had invented . i never knew that . when the film showed the competition , and z - boys did their thing , they put to shame the others in competition .
0 from the makers of underworld , we have , by far , the worst werewolf movie i have ever seen . it is basically a reconstructed version of underworld , yet lacking vampires ( not a big deal ) , cool effects ( a big deal ) , and generally just about everything that can possibly be done right to produce a decent film dealing with lycanthropy ( the biggest deal of them all ! ) . a twenty - something lycanthrope chocolate maker named vivian is currently residing in romania ever since her family was hunted down and executed in front of her years ago in america for being werewolves . there , she belongs to a small society ( or pack ) of werewolves and is apparently chosen to unwillingly we d the pack leader , gabriel , whose son - some toad with a british accent - takes it upon himself to hunt outside of the pack . they have apparently been discovered in other countries prior and want to remain settled in romania by avoiding negative attention , so of course , such activity is considered forbidden . vivian ends up falling in love with an american artist who is oblivious to her involvement with the group of blood - thirsty predators . when they end up discovering the secret relationship , things get messy when someone is killed and the human is forced to participate in a deadly tradition in which he is set loose in the woods and is hunted - giving the pack a chance to transform into their " wolfy " selves . all this really consists of is a big leap before they light up and land as a wolf . very cheezy effects . the entire movie is like a tamed down underworld with some drippy , romantic montages and very little action . watching this in the theater , i could not wait for it to end . a devastatingly boring disappointment . avoid !
0 i watched this basically for the sole reason that it was supposed to have third reich references in it . it turned out a pretty brainless and predictable slasher film that appeared to be made to appeal to feminists or something.<br /><br />let me tell you something , if you wait an entire movie to see the attractive female lead 's breasts , the last thing you want is a " tastefully " done sex scene with annoying camera angles that do n't show anything . her busty friend did n't get hers out either , but we saw plenty of men 's butts and pubic hair and guys with their shirts off . and at the end you have our heroine magically dodging the scalpel thrusts and swings of the villain ( who turns out to be the hunk , funnily enough ) and she easily out fights him ( uh huh ) while her male love interest is tied down and waiting to be rescued . the funniest part was when she picks up a chair and " swings " it at the guy and it breaks over him . now it 'd be about as much as she could manage to lift the chair let alone smash it against a person with enough force to break it ! it looks ridiculous , she basically brushes it against him and it falls apart . if you are going to do this sort of " role reversal " rubbish ( which has already been done to death ) then you have to at least make it semi plausible.<br /><br />there was one good bit though . the bad guy did get the better of her slutty friend , teaching her a lesson for being such a tramp and sleeping around . that 's not exactly something feminists would like.<br /><br />pretty stupid really . not that american slasher flicks are generally much better , but you have to wonder why they bothered . it brought nothing new to the genre at all.<br /><br />5/10
0 this movie was really stupid and i thought that it was n't so bad and i could tolerate a movie about a bed eating people . then the part near the end where the guy has skeleton hands ended up being the cherry on top of a bad movie . i could see the screws in the plastic skeleton hands for goodness sakes . the brother was still alive and moving when his hands were bare bones . the funny thing was that he could still move his hands that was just not right . without muscles , you really ca n't move your hands but he did . the brother should have bled to death even before he was moving his hands . the movie was n't great but it was okay until the hand scene . i was laughing so hard that i do n't really remember how it ended . it had something to do with foam or something .
1 mr. bean has shaped the face of british tv comedy . he has proved that you do not need wicked words or wit , a massive budget , a great deal of intelligence or even any intelligence to make something brilliant . and mr. bean is one of those characters who you just ca n't forget . some of these episodes had me in stitches - yes , they 're not realistic at all and they 're all pretty stupid , but to be honest , realism is one of the barriers bean has broken on its way to greatness . rowan atkinson and co. always manage to cook up interesting new ideas - and hilarious new gags - remember when mr. bean drove his green mini whilst sitting on a sofa on the roof ? mr. bean is one of those things that never gets weak - the movie was n't as good as this , but bean has introduced a distinct new sense of humour to the world , and kids and adults alike will marvel at its immense fun factor . " extras " and " little britain " can be damned - this is british comedy at its best and most original . these escapades never get old ! 10/10
0 i know terry gilliam is considered as a good director but claiming that this movie is good is just foolish . what was the movie about ? what is it a spoof ? fantasy ? comedy ? satire ? no answer there from gilliam 's screenplay . totally confused and pointlessly hurtling from one historical age to another . i find it amusing that some people actually call this movie magical . is it because they have to praise any movie which is vague and indecisive on what it is about ? ? 3 stars for special effects considering it is 1981 . roger ebert has it right in his review . the movie is ambiguous and looks like gilliam 's romp with money just to make a vague children 's move masquerading as a historical revue . the movie also tries to confuse the would - be viewer by giving john cleese and sean connery top billing .
0 i just finished watching dog watch . i thought parts of the movie were hokey with more than a few implausibilities . the acting was n't too bad and the plot was n't bad . but , as the saying goes , the devil was in the details.<br /><br />some examples:<br /><br />1 ) the bleed - through on charlie falon 's ( sam elliott ) bandage was shown to be coming from the back of his hand while it was his knuckles that were bleeding.<br /><br />2 ) would a detective dispose of his murder victim from a very well - lighted area ? this seemed very silly to me.<br /><br />i am not unusually picky about a movie but , in my humble opinion , this one is definitely not recommended by me .
0 tv director uses astral projection to kill people taking the form of the blue man.<br /><br />dull uninvolving horror film that kind of just sits there before your eyes and makes you wonder why you are watching it . i sat through the film to the end and i really ca n't give you more than a cursory account of what the film was about because i kept finding my attention diverted by other things.<br /><br />i ca n't really recommend this . i think my feelings are best summed up by the fact that i paid a dollar for the dvd as a double feature and i feel kind of ripped off .
1 this is the last film of krzysztof kieslowski - one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema . he intended to retire after this film , so in a way it is his artistic testament . he died a couple of years after making the film , and though it is said that he intended to return to directing , destiny decided that this was indeed his last . and what a film!<br /><br />'rouge ' the last film in the three colors french trilogy is actually a very swiss film . set in geneva , one of the two main characters is a swiss retired judge , and durenmatt immediately comes to mind . but there is more switzerland in the cool atmosphere , in the lack of communication of the characters , in the politeness that envelops cruelty of life . several characters who start with little relationship will come together at the end in a moving and human final , which only a great artist could have staged.<br /><br />little else can be said that was not said and written hundred of times . yes , the film starts slowly , and the fans of the american style of action movies or melodramas will get discouraged first and will get lost as viewers . they deserve it . the film gets quality as it advances , and one of the not so hidden messages is that real life and real humans are more interesting than the hollywood cartoon and plastic action and characters . cinema quality is very original , the image being a ' study in red ' , as the title shows . acting is fabulous , with irene jacob and jean - louis trintignant - the later in what will remain probable the best role of his old age . < br /><br />a great film . seeing it again probably adds , and i am happy to have it recorded on tape . 9/10 on my personal scale .
0 this soft soft - core / sci - fi b - movie is what you 'd have if you took an early fred olen ray film and took out the fun . or conversely , it 's like an uwe boll ' movie ' but without as much ineptitude . a young nubile chain - gang convict ( c.c. costigan ) agrees to pose as a space marshal in order to stop wacky kim dawson 's plans of ... having everyone have sex with everyone else apparently ( that vile fiend ) . anyone who went into this film looking for serious science fiction , well you got what you deserved for not doing any homework on the film at all . first of all when did kim dawson ever star in anything other than soft - core skinamax level crap . for that matter take a look at the resume 's for costigan and the director before you take a hissy fit saying you expected something else . do n't get me wrong , for a space / action / soft - core / titillation flick , this film is still not good , but if you expected something along the lines of " contact " , i do not pity you.<br /><br />my grade : d- < br /><br />where i saw it : starz - on - demand ( available until december 8th , 2005 )
0 waters 's contribution to the world of cinema has to be searched with a telescope , and then when / if something is found ( by sheer chance and lots of luck ) it has to be analyzed with a microscope.<br /><br />and after it has been analyzed it would get discarded into the lab 's " rubbish bin for totally useless things " . one single atom of that microscope is worth all of his movies combined.<br /><br />cb is etremely campy , and intentionally so . the usual jw stuff : comic - strip dialogue , simplistic plot , moronically cheerful characters , chewing - gum pop , overacting etc . waters knows that he is incabaple of making a movie of quality , so he hides behind the mask of the " intentionally cheesy film - maker " - which supposedly makes him a special kind of " anti - artist " . but in the world of cinema , being an anti - talent often gets mistaken for talent , which is exactly what waters had hoped for - and eventually got . it 's a con act . charlatans infest the world of cinema and modern pop art ; it 's a plague.<br /><br />perhaps we have john waters to blame for inspiring baz luhrman to make all those horrible , dumb turkeys . it 's like a virus : one waters creates five new bad directors , and then these five each create more , and so on . where will it end ? with " dancer in the dark " ? can that bomb actually be topped ?
0 cuore sacro combines glossy film effects with a story that leaves much to be desired . with a script that the screen - writers for " touched by an angel " might have passed up as being too impuissant , ozpetek still keeps us interested at times . in fact , i wanted to focus on the positives but i found the last act so bafflingly bizarre and awful that i think the couple who jumped to their deaths in the very beginning might have been the fortunate ones.<br /><br />this movie is at heart ( pun intended ) a story built on a big twist - style ending . this kind of tenuous foundation can result in a tremendous success like tornatore 's una pura formalit√† or god - awful garbage like the films of m. night shyamalan . cuore sacro falls somewhat closer to the latter . i found the cinematography in general to be above average . the tracking shots of irene dutifully doing her quotidian laps in the pool were very impressive as was the atmosphere conjured by the interior of her mother 's house . for me , the grotesque parody of michelangelo 's pieta when giancarlo comes in from the rain and irene poses with him was a bit of a stretch . one big issue that i took exception to in this film was ozpetek 's method of simply turning the camera directly into the face of his protagonist and recording the emotions taking place . this worked to fantastic effect in facing windows , but when employed here it seems that bubolova is no mezzogiorno . in fact besides the ridiculous story , the main problem with this film is the milquetoast performance of it 's main character . it made the final breakdown scene even more unconscionably bad . < br /><br />in this movie ozpetek continues his crusade against our corporate - driven societies by urging us to be more spiritual ( not necessarily religious ) and more altruistic . and while i 'm certainly one who is very sympathetic to this view , i felt as if the audience was being hit over the head with a blunt object . could the characters have been anymore two - dimensional ? i tended to find this movie very enervating and soulless . was the " evil " aunt eleonora anything more than a caricature ? it goes for the people on the side of " right " too , like the " good " aunt maria clara and the elderly doorman aurelio . and just in case we might have missed ozpetek 's point , he decided to clothe his opposing forces in their own liveries . < br /><br />this brings me to an interesting point about the director 's use of color . he clothes the opening couple who briefly take flight in all black , as well as irene ( when we first meet her and after her life - conversion ) , the evil aunt eleonora , and of course the good but confused padre carras . black is a color that suggests a definite course , the wearer 's mind is set and emotionless . it is the color of choice for that indispensable item of modern day armor , the business suit . it is also the color of mourning , such as the funerary finery sported by the suicidal duo . finally , black is the color of piety , such as the simple robes of priests and nuns that irene emulates in the second half of the film . < br /><br />the other main color , and a very appropriate choice for a movie about the sacred heart , is red . it is a color that has an extreme inherent emotional component . the character who wears red is bold , emotional , receptive to new ideas , and indulgent . red is a risky color in modern times ; it challenges our perceptions of the wearer and at the same time makes the wearer vulnerable . yet red carries an enormous weight of history and mysticism , as the earliest members of cro - magnon man buried their dead in red ochre and indeed the first man named in the torah , adam , is named after the hebrew word for red . red also has an anachronistic flavor , looking back on the past where red ( and by association a less self - driven attitude towards life ) was more accepted . so when we encounter the red - filled room ( the mysterious frieze covered walls complete with a red accented menorah and a red painting of a whirling dervish ! ) of irene 's mother , " good " characters maria clara and aurelio wearing resplendent outfits of red , and finally the painting of irene 's mother in a formal red gown we can see where ozpetek 's sympathies lie.<br /><br />a word or two about the soundtrack , i found the original musical themes to be excellently suited to the story . the quasi - baroque theme that signified irene was great for it 's monotony and feeling of restive malaise ( the absolute best use of a constantly repeated baroque theme such a this would have to be in kubrick 's barry lyndon , with it 's masterful repetitions of an 8-bar sarabande attributed to handel ) . one absolutely inspired choice was a couple of seconds of an opera aria we hear as the power is flickering while irene is chasing benny through the house . it is of the famous aria " ebben ? ... ne andr√≤ lontano " from catalani 's opera " la wally " . the aria is sung by the lead soprano who is leaving home forever . as irene 's mother was a dramatic soprano , we can guess that this is a recording of her singing and that she is saying a poignant farewell to her daughter , as in the movie irene is soon destined to never again see benny alive . i just have one minor question of the soundtrack , why include the famous tango yo soy maria ? i love the song and personally could hear it all the time , but it did n't really fit here .
0 cybrog 2:glass shadow stars elias koteas as colton hicks ( rhymes with kicks ! ) a karate instructor who helps a cash ( jolie ) escape from pinwheel , her creators who look to detonate her and destroy a rival company . along the way billy drago and karen shepherd show up to displace the duo , while jack palance is there to deliver guidance to the duo on the run . one of the things that is quite shocking about the cyborg franchise , is how the series has managed to have quite prolific and off beat actors in the cast . the original had jean - claude van damme and dayle haddon ( do n't know her ? well she was in a bunch of 70 's pornos ) this one has jack palance , elias koteas , billy drago and angelina jolie . the third one has william katt , zach galligan and malcom mcdowell . ( okay so , cyborg 3 's cast is n't that impressive . ) i 've never seen cyborg 3 , but i did see this on sci - fi channel and must admit i was n't impressed . actually strike that , cyborg 2 is an often lovely looking movie , it 's shot with excellent style and the visual detail make this easy on the eye . however cyborg 1 was the same way , indeed the movie was directed with a certain amount of style , slow motion and music that made it all easy on the eye . unfortunately like the first , this one does n't have any new ideas or anything resembling a plot or texture . most of the ideas are taken from blade runner and max headroom , so for various reasons the movie does n't have much to offer beyond it 's look . another aspect is the terrible acting . karen shepherd and billy drago are absolutely terrible and angelina jolie is n't much better . elias koteas and jack palance come off fine but seriously palance is playing a cyborg warrior and koteas is a karate instructor . i guess on the positive side you ca n't accuse michael schroeder of not being ambitious with casting . still the movie is dull and i for one lost interest in the story fifteen minutes in . also why did they tie it in with cyborg anyway ? it has nothing to do with it 's predecessor , which this manages to be worse than.<br /><br / > * out of 4-(bad )
1 this is an entertaining surreal road movie . it was written by joseph minion , who also wrote after hours , martin scorsese 's excellent surreal film . the film follows the adventures of a ten - year - old kid named gus , who drives a red ford mustang across some fictional states with names like tristana ( a tribute to luis bu√±uel 's film , perhaps ? ) , essex & south lyndon , in search of eight elusive motorama game cards from various chimera company gas stations . the film has a surreal feel to it because a lot of the things are unusual , like the money for instance , which is like blank paper with numbers on.<br /><br />most of the characters are nasty to gus on his trip . they tattoo him , punch him , but this does n't stop the kid on his relentless quest . some oddball actors like david lynch incumbent jack nance , meat loaf & flea also make appearances . jack nance plays a motel owner , who when he first meets gus tells him , " if you see any squirrels , give them to me " . this is a movie where a man and his wife abandon their young children because the man owes gus $ 100 ; and a mother encourages her son to raise his voice louder while speaking rudely . if you 're a fan of twin peaks and surreal movies , you 'll like this . an odd little gem of a movie .
1 i completely disagree with the other comments ! i too saw this film at an early screening and found it quite enjoyable . robin williams is in top form . true , the tone is familiar , but it is williams of good morning vietnam : smart , funny , on point . after too many dark turns , williams is finally back to what he does best . the supporting actors give great performances , especially laura linney and chris walken . chris plays himself , as usual , but as the " agent " to the next president he was a delight each time on screen . lewis black plays only himself basically , but he is wonderfully well used here . there is also a fun turn by jeff goldblum . the movie is more than what the trailer suggests , as well . the movie is funny , but it is not a pure comedy as suggested . it has a bit of a thriller line , which everyone should seriously consider , especially if you pay attention to the newspaper .
1 this era was not just the dawn of sound in cartoons , but of a cartoon character which would go down in history as the world 's most famous mouse . yes , mickey makes his debut here , in this cheery tale of life on board a steamboat . the animation is good for it 's time , and the plot - though a little simple - is quite jolly . a true classic , and if you ever manage to get it on video , you wo n't regret it .
1 the promise of martin donovan playing jesus was , quite honestly , enough to get me to see the film . definitely worthwhile ; clever and funny without overdoing it . the low - quality filming was probably an appropriate effect but ended up being a little too jarring , and the ending sounded more like a pbs program than hartley . still , too many memorable lines and great moments for me to judge it harshly .
1 jack webb finally gives something besides his usual wooden indian performance . he played the epitome of the jarhead , brainwashed , storm the beaches , semper fi , bonehead military idiot . the corps before all else , even humanity . this great film showed the idiosy of boot camp to it 's fullest . 4 stars .
1 i have spent many years studying all the great directors , like kurosawa , lean , fulci , lenzi , deodato , peckinpah , kubrick and admire them greatly . my favourite film is once upon a time in america.<br /><br />i have only recently become a fan of d'amato , and while he was no horror master , his films were extreme whether it be soft core , hardcore or extreme.<br /><br />porno holocaust is now one of my favourite films , the way its shot is brilliant and the music is catchy.<br /><br />joe d'amato , was n't a horror master , he 's no fulci or bava , but however he was a master of erotica , no other director could shoot erotic films like him , he also never tried making any films outside of these genre 's either.<br /><br />long live joe d'aamto - master of porn and erotica !
1 the kinks warned about media heroes . outside the movies , most heroes are also " ordinary people . " society demands some role playing , but what happens when that extends to the parent - child relationship ? do some parents try to improve themselves through their children rather than vice versa ? how do you provide a role - model but not a role ? a brilliant swimmer who hates to swim ; a brilliant musician who wo n't play . offbeat , funny ( despite depiction of " serious " problems ) , very good multi - dimensional acting by everyone . lots of plot twists complement the emotional tension . celluloid heroes never feel any pain . i do n't recall ever being disappointed in a sigourney weaver film ( i even liked " the village " ! ) .
1 " where to begin , where to begin . . ? ( savannah in the episode " gimme shelter " ) " to disabuse : fox / viacom does not , at this point in time , have any intention of releasing the show on dvd . but be not downhearted ! that you are reading this reveals that the magic lingers fifteen years on . . . and small wonder . this was post - modern television , a valiant attempt to visualize magical realism . ' neath the blue patina , charm , and brio were scripts bursting with symbolism and metaphor , music that actually interacted with scenes ! and , ultimately , an attempt , however doomed , to recapture one 's belief in innocence , to reclaim eden , as it were . . . it 's potency is perhaps best attested to by the fact that even as we , umm , type , a book is being written about the show wherein will be found the thoughts , fancies , and reminiscences of many of the show 's actors , writers , directors , and producers . in the meanwhiles . . . anyone desirous of once again visiting the end of the world and reacquainting themselves with seamus , sheriff cody , savannah , et al . . . should not hesitate to contact me , i may be able to make you a copy .

1 he 's not your conventional cab driver.<br /><br />this guys got issues . with his wife , with his son , a priest , all his fares , his ex - partner and most of all himself . and the greatest thing is they just throw us all into it . so we have to keep watching to find out more about his past.<br /><br />the idea may not be original but david morse makes it so . i think this is a great show , and i hope people catch - on before the season 's over . < br /><br />watch this show ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
1 the last of the sequels , not counting abbott and costello meet frankenstein which was more or less a spoof.this time count dracula ( john carridine)takes center stage seeking a cure for his vampirism from a kindly doc(onslow stevens).well good ole larry talbot(lon chaney jr)shows up also seeking a cure.the good doc succeeds in curing larry 's werewolfism , but dracula tricks the doc and ends up contaminating his blood and makes the good doc a crazed lunatic.oh and all this time big franky(glenn strange)lies on a table awaiting his electricity fix so he can wreak some havoc.this was kind of a short movie , around 70 minutes and some change , but the action is there , and the great actors are there as well . lionel atwill turns up as a police inspector , heres some trivia , lionel atwill appeared in son of frankenstein , ghost of frankenstein , frankenstein meets the wolf - man , and house of frankenstein . and then this one.if there was another in the series they may have added the creature from the black lagoon to the line up , i'm giving house of dracula 8 out of 10 .
1 so the wwe has done it . they have poured over into film;their first one being see no evil , starring their very own kane . i caught this movie and went in not expecting it to be a great film ... it just seemed to clich√© and looked like nothing new . to my surprise it actually was n't half bad . a viewer stated above that it is good b - horror movie fun , and honestly that s the best way to describe it . now the question i was asking myself was how was kane going to hold up ... well let 's just say he made an absolute bad ass out of the ' jacob goodnight ' character . he sold the role really well , and really did look menacing . but what can you expect from someone who is almost 7 feet tall and weighs around 320 in solid muscle . the acting was decent , and the story was nothing new of course , but we all know that . the directing as well as the cinematography was done very well and the hotel backdrop really looked dilapidated and well done . considering this was directed by a porn movie director , i was quite surprised . i 'd recommend this movie if you 're looking for mindless gore and killing and just some overall fun . think of this movie as a modern day latter friday the 13th film . and save room for the ending too , cuz it 's a good one . and stick around after the credits too ...
1 it starts off with a view of earth and jupiter aligned.<br /><br />where do we come from , and where we are headed.<br /><br />the story starts with " the dawn of man " , a documentary - like view of the pre - historic grass - eater ape that was facing its extinction due to no physical ability that would let him hunt to eat , and the lack of grass and water in the austral africa . the monkeys had n't survived if it was n't for the " god - like " intervention of an alien artifact , that somehow transformed the apes that touched it , and gave them the ability to use tools , that were first used as weapons that allowed them to kill pigs to eat for super and to kill other monkeys in fights for water . that ape was man . an enigmatic start for an enigmatic film.<br /><br />after the fast - forward that leaves the movie at the present days , we see a magnificent dance of spaceships at the sound of strauss . the rest of the movie is about how tools got control of man . the strange artifact appears once again to evolve man to his final stage : the starchild.<br /><br />at 1968 , the year this movie was released , only astronauts had idea of what was out there in space . after this movie , that changed . it 's futurism took 7 years to be explored . the special effects are incredible . they are completely realistic , even today.<br /><br />the directing , along with excellent taste in music , good acting , and the fantastic filmography , makes it an epic.<br /><br />the plot , with its vision of the year 2001 and the evolution of man tools , with an ai psycokiller , with the psycotropical hypnotising end , makes it the trip our lives.<br /><br />if you have never seen this movie , see it . do n't be scared with the lack of dialog , sit back and enjoy . it 's a symphony of evolution . it 's terrific .
0 this movie was perhaps the biggest waste of 2 hours of my life . from the opening 10 minutes , i was ready to leave . the cliches there slapping you in the face , and the plot was not only predictably stupid , but full of more holes than swiss cheese . i am considering suing for that lost 2 hours , and $ 6.25 along with the fact that i am now stupider for watching this waste of film . the t - rex 's must be flipping in their graves , so to speak .
1 nicely done evil little comedy pitting the fbi against organized crime with a nice lady caught in the middle . the actress who played the jealous wife of the mob boss ' tony the tiger ' almost stole the show with her raging tantrums . 3 stars
0 last fall ( of 2001 ) , i took a film class that was taught by the director of this movie ( mark hoeger ) . his vast knowledge of filmmaking , his ability to dissect any scene of a film , and his winning of an academy award in some obscure category seemed to give him more credibility than your average independent film director . when he mentioned during one of his classes that he had just finished directing a film called " full ride " and was in the post - production stages , my interest was piqued . however , that would be the last i would ever hear of that film project . until last week ... <br /><br />last week , i saw in a tv listing that " full ride " was going to be showing on the wb network . this immediately raised a red flag , as i ca n't help but associate wb with teensploitation shows such as dawson 's creek , charmed , etc . plus , the fact that full ride was going to be released straight to tv was n't too flattering in itself . but , nevertheless , i set aside that time and sat down to watch my former film teacher 's creation.<br /><br />after two hours passed and the end credits began to roll , i thought long and hard about what i had just seen . what i had just seen was a typical wb - quality show stretched out to the length of two hours . in fact , it almost seemed as if this movie was made with the sole intent of only showing on the wb network . critiquing this movie will basically be like critiquing a typical wb show.<br /><br />where to begin ? the characters are shallow , the story is cliche in every sense of the word , the scenes are completely contrived , and the character development is forced and unbelievable . this movie just screams ` unoriginal.'<br /><br />the main character , matt sabo , is some hot shot from the wrong side of the tracks ( literally ) who plays solid high school football as a fullback , but then fizzles off into a life of crime . he is then offered a chance at a full ride scholarship instead of going to jail . obviously , without much of a choice , he agrees to play football with an all - star football team , but is not excepted among his peers because of his poor team spirit and bad attitude.<br /><br />then comes the love interest . of course ! where would this predictable fanfare be without a love interest ? she comes in the form of amy lear ( played by the beautiful meredith monroe ) . she is actually a likable character , as opposed to the ever - so - abrasive matt sabo , so we almost applaud her when she rejects him at first . but , of course , the inevitable comes to pass . she falls for him , changes his attitude towards everything , and all seems good and happy . but now it 's time for conflict!<br /><br />earlier in the movie , amy makes it clear to matt that she does n't want to score with him , because it would be ` shameful ' to her and her mother . this is much to matt 's dismay , and his football buddies ( yes , they eventually warm up to him ) who bet him he would n't get any . but , of course , matt eventually comes to accept these terms and decides he 's not all about the nookie . here 's where the exciting plot thickens . if you do n't want me to ruin this surprise , then skip ahead.<br /><br />[begin spoiler]<br /><br />matt finds out from some local guys that apparently amy lear always tries to score with a guy each year from the all - star team so that she can try to use him to escape her small town life of working in a cafeteria ( which is baffling in the first place ) and make it to the big city . suddenly realizing he 's been used and that his love was a sham , matt it tempted to turn back to a life of crime and leave the football camp before ` the big game . ' amy tries to reassure him that she was really in love this time , but he 's too hot - headed to buy it . so what will matt do ? will he take her back ? or will he go back to robbing gas stations and being an all - round jerk ? i wo n't ruin the super - ultra - surprising ending for you.<br /><br />[end spoiler]<br /><br />so , if i somehow got you pumped up for this movie , please realize that that was my sarcasm and not genuine enthusiasm . this movie is an uninspired version of ` varsity blues ' or ` summer catch . ' and that 's not saying much . there 's hardly any comedy to save it and the characters are too shallow to care about . so what do you have left ? not a whole lot.<br /><br />what i most disliked about the movie was how much of an unflattering picture hoeger painted of nebraska through this film . it seems like he was trying to capture the essence of rural nebraska and teenage life in the small towns , but his approach is all too stereotypical and shallow . the characters ' high hopes for making in ` the big city ' and the actions they take to do so are greatly exaggerated , and it only further cements the stereotype of nebraskans being a bunch of hicks living in farm communities . i am unsure of whether or not hoeger 's intentions were good in trying to put his home state in the spotlight , but i think he ended up with a very shameful product . if hoeger wanted to portray nebraska in a favorable light , he should have taken a note or two from alexander payne . while payne simply chooses to use nebraska as a backdrop for his films , hoeger integrates it into the plot of full ride and becomes so entangled in his awareness of where he 's shooting , that he ends up churning out superficial garbage that would seem to come from an outsider . if hoeger actually lived here , you 'd think he 'd know better than that.<br /><br />all in all , i am completely disappointed in hoeger 's first big film , and i hope that next time he can combine his knowledge with a little bit of originality to create something different and thought - provoking .
0 dennis quaid is tryin ' hard to prove us that jerry lee lewis was a dumb guy . and he 's doing too much to prove it . tv sequences are very good , like a photocopy of old black and white footages . music is fine too , because mr. lewis himself is singing . but the rest is just hollywood b - movie style , with the fifties happy days complex . i think the only good thing in this movie is to see young winona ryder .
0 i have one word : focus.<br /><br />well.<br /><br />imdb wants me to use at least ten lines of text . okay . let 's discuss the fine points of focus . i do n't know about the rest of you , but in my first year of film school they taught us a lot of useless crap , like ' you 'll all be famous avant - garde filmmakers someday'--but they also taught us how to do this crazy thing called focusing the lens ! it was amazing ! you give a little twist and wham ! everything is clear as a bell . the person who shot what alice found needs to learn a few things about the finer points of focus . lighting , too . this movie is not only completely out of focus , it 's also lit like the corner of someone 's basement.<br /><br />don't even get me started on pacing or plot . they could have trimmed about ten seconds off the beginning and end of every single shot.<br /><br />but who cares about that anyhow ? there is not enough lurid in this movie to make up for the utter lack of regard to film 's best friends -- focus , and lighting.<br /><br />words to the wise .
0 this is a terrible movie , that is barely recognizable from the book , although they have sort of similar plots . the time it takes to watch this movie ( which is only 1.5 hours ) would be much better spent doing anything else , including watching grass grow . the addition of poorly done fantasy scenes make catherine seem insufferably silly . the actress who plays catherine also comes across ditzy as all goodness and looks constantly surprised , even when she 's supposed to be looking lovingly into her tilney 's eyes . honestly ! ! the movie ends with a catherine fantasy - like scene where one ca n't help but wonder if it 's happened or if she 's merely delusional , and not in the good way that makes you think but in a perfectly horrible way that basically sums up the terrible movie . the only good thing about the movie is the title , which was written by ms. austen herself . i generally love the bbc 's productions but this one is horrid .
1 while boris(aleksey batalov)is off to fight in war against the germans for his mother russia , his beloved veronika(tatyana samojlova)marries his conniving cousin mark(aleksandr shvorin)in a moment of weakness shortly after her parents were killed in an air raid over moscow . through various trials and betrayals , veronika will await word or letter from boris no matter how long it takes , holding hope that he will return to her.<br /><br />powerful piece of film - making boasts simply incredible photographic work by cinematographer sergei urusevsky . some of the many magnificently framed , moving shots include the scene where the camera follows veronika through a crowd of loved ones saying goodbye to each other as she rushes through the mob of bodies to say goodbye to boris .. and does n't quite reach him even as we watch boris looking impatiently into the swarm without luck . the sequence after the air raid where veronika walks up the standing stairs circulating up the destroyed building she once called home and the scene where mark makes his lustful move on veronika as another air raid continues just outside the building as wind rustles the curtains and flashes of light emanate inside are just two of many examples where sergei urusevsky shows his genius at framing images that will last forever on film . but , without the power and tragedy of the story regarding how war can forever shape the destiny of a couple who dearly , deeply love each other , this film could n't hold up with the beauty of the visual alone . together , however , we 're left with an amazing film .. simply a haunting masterpiece from the soviet union after stalin breathed his last breath . i feel honored just have beheld such a great film .
0 just to save you the $ 3 , or whatever it costs to rent movies at your local video store , and the anguishing hour - and - however - long - this - movie - is here 's a simple plan . go over to a friend 's house , talk them into renting the pest for you , watch the first 30 seconds or so and then make up some excuse to leave . the opening sequence is really funny , definitely worth watching . unfortunately , the other 99 % of the movie is horrible . without the shower scene at the beginning this is one of the worst movies of all time .
0 i was hoping to like this movie , to settle in for an evening of goofy fun . i like judy davis and juliette lewis , and the premise seemed off the wall enough to be entertaining.<br /><br />unfortunately , i found myself dozing over and over again . judy davis gave a fine performance , but had very little to work with . juliette lewis was fabulous as expected , but had very little to do . the plot was full of " twists " that were just plain silly , and as so often happens in movies of this type , nobody acted the way a real human being would act . and , personally , i thought marcia gay harden was totally miscast.<br /><br />the movie also seemed to shift about midway from a black comedy with touches of farce to a total farce with touches of black comedy . one reviewer here notes that other reviews seem to want this movie to be something different , and therefore decried it . all i can say is that i would have settled for the movie being * something * and sticking with it . this one feels like the director had some grandiose ideas but was n't able to pull them all off . i give it a 4 out of 10 .
1 yes , 2:37 is in some ways a rip off from gus van sants elephant . it 's about some students who are dealing with their problems leading to the suicide of one of them . yes , it 's full of clich√©s , but that 's life . you just ca n't deny that creepy nerds , disabled persons or popular students who , despite their popularity , do have problems are existing in the real world.<br /><br />but that 's not , what this film is all about . it 's not about life in highschool . it 's not about the misery of life itself.<br /><br />if you look beneath the surface , beneath the soap - like social relationships that are shown , you will find some gripping , thought - provoking criticism of our society.<br /><br />why are people committing suicide ? do we really understand their motives ? or are we just trying to understand , after its already too late ? and why is it always someone , you would never have expected it to be?<br /><br />this movie does n't answer this question , but it raises it . and it does so in a very intense way . all the way it keeps you guessing , whose blood it might be , that you see at the very beginning . you are following the paths of some students , all of them having a more or less good reason to end their lives , just to be forced to watch the gruesome act in the finale.<br /><br />did you know who it would be ? or were you caught by surprise , like in real life?<br /><br />the message is verbalized by one of the surviving kids in the end . we are always so fixed on our own problems , we forget to see those of others . there might be someone , a colleague , a friend , who does not want to live anymore . but , if you do n't open your eyes , you 'll never know until its too late.<br /><br />this movie delivers well . it might have some flaws , but they do n't matter anymore , when its over . either you see a reflection of society , or you are blind for reality .
1 i 've been looking forward to seeing this film ever since i first caught the trailer , and i 'm so glad now that i have . it 's truly a wonderful film . the actors are superb , the writing is fresh and real , the whole thing was just spot - on . i love james mcavoy in this , and i ca n't wait to see him in " the lion , the witch , and the wardrobe " movie this december . romola garai is wonderful too . be sure to check her out in " i capture the castle " or " nicholas nickleby , " two of my favorite films . overall , i think i liked this movie because it did n't chicken out . it 's a difficult subject matter to tell a story about , in that you 're very likely to offend a lot of people or mess up and make it into some overly - sentimental - sugary - sweet love fest . but they avoided doing that completely , and instead made a film that 's real , honest , and touching , yes , but never over - the - top . very well done . amazingly well done . go out and see it , and you 'll know exactly what i mean .
1 sherlock holmes ( basil rathbone ) and professor moriarty ( lionel atwill ) engage in a battle of wits for control of a switz inventor 's newest bomb - sight creation . holmes wants to safeguard it for the british while moriarty is n't above selling out to the nazis . < br /><br />while no doubt many fans will be disappointed to see holmes updated to the 1940s war - time setting , this particular film proves light - hearted fun which does n't wallow in wartime propaganda as it might well have done . dennis hoey 's inspector lestrade and nigel bruce 's dr. watson do tend to steal the show as their characters bumbling methods consistently provide delightful comic relief . the sparring between holmes and moriraty is colorful and well thought out to boot . atwill does well enough as moriarty even if he 's not as memorable as some others who played the role . < br /><br />while this provides nothing especially new or thrilling for fans of the series , it is a wonderful escape from reality , somewhat appropriate for 1942 in my opinion , that mirrors many movie serial adventures of the 1930s and 1940s but boasts a more compact , less repetitive plot . and all this is done while still remaining true to the basic spirit of sherlock holmes .
1 this is yet another gem from the pen of daniele thompson - in fact that same year ( 1999 ) she wrote and directed la buche , the first of three writer / director credits so far . belle maman is first of all ' french ' whatever that means which is , of course , different things to different folks . the premise is simple : at the altar where he is marrying mathilde seigner , the groom , vincent lindon , gets his first glimpse of her mother , catherine deneuve , and suffers what the french call a coup de foudre which we know as love at first sight . in theory the story is either 1 ) over right then and there assuming he called the wedding off or else 2)just the beginning as he goes through with the wedding and thus lives a lie until it is resolved one way or the other . thompson veers towards # 2 but not without hitting us with the odd subplot along the way like , for example , deneuve 's cigar - smoking lesbian mother line renaud ( in real life , if anyone cares , renaud is in a long - term relationship with stephane audran , who co - stars here ) and throws in a brilliant set - piece in a luxuriously appointed men 's room at the wedding reception , which takes the form of a hilarious song - and - dance . consummate writer that she is thompson also leavens the comedy with drama like the brilliant climactic scene where vincent finally spews out his feelings for deneuve at a family gathering whilst simultaneously wrecking the joint . this is one to savour . again and again .
1 since growing up in czechoslovakia i was following history of raf pilots and crews in wwii great britain , their stories and tragic ending either in the combat or in communist prisons and camps . this is without any doubt more than dark chapter in our history , although the fact that those brave men we 're able to go through all this and recover afterward is amazing . to all people who want to see great movie ... this is the one ! during recent visit of czech republic i saw this movie three times in three days ( they we 're just playing it for three days ... otherwise i will go to see it even few more times ! ! ! it 's worth of it ! ) i hope you will enjoy it , although it requires a little more thinking and knowledge of background information behind the story , pretty much same way that the movie " kolya " was . it 's not a simple movie because of it 's deep story , and the way its told will most likely make you crying ... it did to me three times in row ... zdenek sverak did as always a great script , his son jan made a great movie and the cast ? without doubt all of them did great job , i was amazed by ondrej vetchy , by great role played by oldrich kaiser and all other actors which made this movie simply great ! ! ! if this is not an oscar nomination i think that i will be on strike in holywood .
0 ok , this simply is the worst movie ever made . period . horrible acting , sets and music . ok , everything sucks in this movie . i almost forgot ! the special effects are " great " also . so if you like bad movies , watch this , it can surely make you laugh ! !
1 i watched this movie three times at different ages of my life and always did enjoy it very much indeed . this can - can is an authentic explosion of joie de vivre , like stanley donen and gene kelly musical , but in french way . and a jean renoir nice tribute to his time , his friends , lovers , music and dances . it is at same time a show business chronicle of that age , full of affection and french mood . it is too a clear tribute to the impressionism ( people who likes impressionistic painters will like this picture ) . it is particularly a tribute to toulouse - lautrec and , of course , to jean renoir father , pierre - auguste . you will find hear a trustworthy and splendid colored recreation of some renoir master work . excellent casting , scenery , sound - effects and music . even it tell us about the creation of parisian moulin rouge , obviously it is a fiction story ( and not very original by the way , as it fall down in the very well know moral that the show must go on ) . but the jean renoir production is great.<br /><br / >
1 when i saw this film at a festival years ago i was very impressed and i started to looking for it . nothing to do , not in the cinemas , nor on dvd neither on blue ray . absolutely nothing ! ! ! how it 's possible this could really happen ? ? ? the direction is impeccable , the story is intriguing and has been filmed in a very original way the music it 's perfect and james franco is hot as hell!!!<br /><br />please release this master piece and allow it to have it 's proper life ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! this is really a very great movie that people should see and it deserve another chance ! ! ! ! ! ! < br /><br />edvard
0 well , i 'm a huge fan and follower of elizabeth berkley . i bought this on dvd off of ebay for my boyfriends birthday . we sat down to watch it and it was so boring . i do n't remember laughing once . it 's only on for about an hour and half and it seemed to take forever to end . elizabeth is great in this though . maybe it 's just because i 'm a big elizabeth berkley fan though . if she was n't in it i would n't have watched it but every time she came on my face lit up . unfortunately even elizabeth could n't save this film . just the overall story and awful comedy makes this a film you 'd rather miss than waste an hour and a half of your life . it 's a very forgetful film .
0 this film truly was poor . i went to the theatre expecting something exciting , and instead was afforded the opportunity to hone my " guess the next plot twist before it happens " skills . seriously , the plot was written with an extra thick crayon so everyone could see . nothing was truly shocking . in fact , even the gore was met with such complete suspension of belief that it really did n't add up to much.<br /><br />the excessive wise cracking and cops talking shop at the crime scenes made it seem all the more phony . and the scene where lambert 's character is struggling with the clues and reaches his " investigative epiphany " goes to great lengths to indicate the level of intellect expected from the audience - little.<br /><br />probably the most annoying aspect of the cinematography was the " x - files " treatment : every building in the film , whether it 's the precinct building , or a house at noon , or a hospital , was suffering from a lack of any discernible lighting ( not to mention a lack of ' patients ' in the case of the hospital ) . i do n't recall a single scene when someone flipped on a light switch . it sure would have been nice.<br /><br />mr . lambert really is n't an oscar - grade actor , so i suppose you have to take this film for what it 's worth . in the end , i 've reached the conclusion that the only thing that would make this film seem more entertaining is to watch it after watching " the warriors " . otherwise , you 're left with an effort that is dull and unoriginal , and nowhere near the equal of films of the genre such as " silence of the lambs " .
0 what movie is this ? ? ? a horrible movie with the old boring concept of infidelity which has already been achieved by the " bhatt camp " . the movie starrs emraan hashmi , udita goswami and dino morea . the movie has " no base " . it just goes like this ... dino an udita are married and living in a rich mansion . however dino does n't like udita to the heart as he wants only her wealth . he loves someone else ( tara sharma ) . so he bribes emraan to have an affair with udita so that he could catch them and finally split up with udita .. how boring ! ! however emraan falls in love with udita and vice versa . lastly when udita gets imprisonment for killing emraan , dino pretentiously tries to save her showing his false love to her . udita on the other hand does not understand this and feels that he loved her truly . so she lends all her wealth to dino . finally dino comes out of the police - station and goes with tara with all the wealth . what a fraud ! ! the songs are good and are the only thing good in the movie . now the individual ratings : ( out of 5 ) emraan : * * udita : * 1/2 dino : * 1/2 overall acting : * 1/2 direction : * * story : * music : * * * 1/2 final rating : * 1/2 poor performances and poor casting ....... music : good ... i rate the movie : 1.5 / 10 ( do nt waste your time ! ! ! ! )
0 spoiler alert!!!!<br /><br />i do n't go into ' high tech ' movies expecting them to be 100 % accurate on all things computer related . but somehow , even the average ' i have a computer ' user is supposed to believe that:<br /><br />1 ) a computer professional with a top secret , special data < br /><br />2 ) is going to keep the primary copy of said data on a 1.44 floppy < br /><br />3 ) and make absolutely no backup of this special secret data < br /><br />even high school students back up their homework for goodness sake.<br /><br />also this is the worst represntation of a computer nerd ever . even though she is super cute we are supposed to believe that she has no friends , neighbors , extended family , or coworkers who can identify her . even the unabomber had a family that could turn him in.<br /><br />end spoiler < br /><br />these are n't just minor mistakes that had no bearing on the movie - these are the major plot points that fueled the storyline . the characterization was awful , the plot wholly unbeleivable , and if you have n't seen this , do n't bother .
0 it 's hard to work up any enthusiasm for this awful cartoon - like epic that for some reason has become a cult classic . it certainly ca n't be because of the totally artificial look of the set designs or the limpid acting of an all - star cast . these days it 's shown much too frequently on fox movie channel or amc.<br /><br />it pains me to report that veteran actors like walter pigeon and joan fontaine are even cast in this muddled science fiction travesty , none of which rings true . it 's like watching an expensive budget being spent on a saturday afternoon kiddie show full of cardboard characters and unconvincing dialog . it 's a comic book version of the jules verne novel.<br /><br />the maturing fontaine was still attractive but wears a pained expression on her face , perhaps regretting that she had accepted the role of the psychiatrist before reading the script . she contributes absolutely nothing to her cardboard role but an imperial and uncomfortable presence and looks totally out of place most of the time . faring no better are robert sterling , barbara eden and -- most of all , peter lorre -- as well as frankie avalon , who gets to sing the title tune which -- it 's safe to say -- did not become anyone 's favorite title tune.<br /><br />an awfully frustrating experience to sit through a film like this which wastes an attractive cast and is an insult to almost anyone 's intelligence . totally unconvincing from start to finish . the film , as well as the fantastic submarine , sinks to the bottom of the sea long before the fight with a rubber octopus brings the film to a dreary conclusion .
0 this is a film that really makes me cringe . in 1951 , mgm and looney toons were making some of their very best cartoons -- with amazing animation , exceptional backgrounds and great stories . then , in the late 40s , a new style of animation began to appear ( such as the " crusader rabbit " series on tv)--animation with extremely simplistic artwork in order to save money . unfortunately , columbia picture 's cynical ploy worked ! ! instead of the public hating the toons ( as they should have ) , many accepted them and the oscar people ( ampas ) actually gave this film the award for best animated short -- giving legitimacy for an inferior product . unfortunately , in the dollars and sense world of hollywood , this soon began to creep into the products of legitimate studios -- resulting in rather crappy cartoons . later , it got even worse as in addition to lousy animation and backgrounds , the stories themselves became almost unbearable for adults to watch . the cleverness and style of the classic cartoons were gone . and for this tragedy , i blame , in part , gerald mcboing - boing -- one of the granddaddies of cheap cartoons . the story is n't that bad but the animation is a horror and listening to the kid saying " boing - boing " incessantly is a pain .
1 englar alheimsins are very good movie . she happen on a mental home in iceland . ingvar e. sigurdsson is in a leading role and is good . other good actors in this movie are baltasar korm√°kur and bjorn jorundur . i like this movie she is very good . i voice with this movie .
0 i would agree with another viewer who wrote that this movie recalls the offbeat melanie griffith / jeff daniels comedy , " something wild , " in which a rather eccentric free - spirit hooks up with a conservative and very orderly young man , and the two pose as a couple and basically , her personality gradually has an effect on him . he looses up and learns to enjoy their short - lived tryst . that is exactly what happens here , except insert convenient store - robbing eccentric , alex ( rosanna arquette ) in melanie griffith 's role , and super - cautious teen , lincoln ( the name is no coincidence , played by devon gummersall ) in jeff daniel 's part . this movie even shares the same twist and abrupt genre change where the creepy , violent boyfriend suddenly shows up in the end and things end up quite badly . only , here , instead of it being ray liotta playing a throwback to 1950s film goons , it 's peter greene.<br /><br />the story is about a teenage kid who is in his own little world . he has some sort of fascination with death following his brother 's suicide , and his parents have disconnected , too , behaving quite strangely ( the mother is convinced christmas will be arriving shortly , despite it being august ) . then , on a night out with the " guys " ( one of whom is played by jason hervey of the wonder years ) trying to buy them beer , he runs into alex who decides to kidnap him and his friends car ( with his permission of course ) , and they take off for mini - adventure across the deserts of the west coast , robbing convenient stores in robin hood sort of fashion and of course , indulging in the routine self - discovery as each asks more about the other 's life . but , alex has left behind a partner in her trade of theft , and he is n't going away easily . although , we 're not consistently reminded of him or anything as in repetitive flashback or cutting over to his point of view . at least this much was done cleverly.<br /><br />'do me a favor ' ( aka trading favors ) , is a mostly underdeveloped story of criminal mischief and self - discovery that lags quite a bit for the first half of the film , but delivers the goods a little to late once alex and lincoln arrive at her home out in the middle of nowhere . by the time the filmmakers give you enough stimulation , the film is unfortunately , almost over . i would recommend that if this is the sort of story you 're in the mood for , and despite rosanna arquette always giving a good performance ( even in a poorly written film ) , i would still recommend catching this in its best form , " something wild . "
1 some of the reviewers here have foolishly judged this silent film by political - correctness standards of today . < br /><br />"battle " was an excellent film for several reasons , correctly noted by more rational reviewers : superb cast , lots of action , innovative editing and photography . < br /><br />its stars were in effect the d.w. griffith stock company and to this silent movie fan , that is inducement enough to watch it and to enjoy it . < br /><br />i saw it many years ago and just watched it again at youtube ; that was a very poor quality print , but coupled with my memory of a good print in a real theater , i can justifiably recommend this to reasonable people and film historians .
0 this film has been lauded to the point of the ridiculous . " american movie " is a boring documentary about a boring person so ordinary you 'll find equivalents on just about every corner in america . it takes a long , hard look at a guy who 's failed at just about everything in the interest of making an independent movie .. or two . were his failures for other than his own selfish pursuits or were they in the name of real art , the movie might have had a chance . america has an abundance of better stories to be told . this one should be flushed and many critics have good reason to be ashamed . two thumbs up indeed !
1 just love the interplay between two great characters of stage & screen - veidt & barrymore
0 this one kind of is like an earlier movie from 1987 " masters of the universe " based on the cartoon " he - man " . basically , you have a great old world and they for some reason have to have nearly all the action of the movie take place on modern earth . well i guess it is not so modern earth now and that it is an ancient world now of strangeness and a den of good times gone by . well i guess i can figure why they did in fact place nearly all the movie in modern times in this and that movie . to save money on costumes and sets . it is a lot easier to recreate what is going on in the present than a strange world like that of eternia in he - man or an ancient world with cults and strange pyramids , sacrifices and strange creatures that hug you to death . this movie is forgettable and not very entertaining , your first clue that it is not going to be the best movie in the world is that robert z'dar is in it . the only thing this one has going for it is the animals which are not as prevalent in this one as they were in the last . marc singer is back and it is sad to seem him in this state , the guy was a fairly good actor reduced to trying to make a sequel to a movie that really did not need one , and even if it did it came five years to late .
0 now and again , a film comes around purely by accident that makes you doubt your sanity . we just finished studying the novel , " northanger abbey " , at school and decided to refresh our memory of this unexciting piece of humourless garbage with the bbc adaptation.<br /><br />the funny thing about northanger abbey is that it actually makes you want to kill yourself . the film is nothing like the book , for example , the subtly evil characters seem to have been turned into transparent stereotypes . john thorpe looks like a leprechaun on acid while isabella plays the role of slut . catherine , the main character , is the most depressingly stupid and irritating actress on god 's earth ( she looks like a coffee addict , her eyes are like basketballs ) whilst mr tilney looks and acts like a retired porno stunt double . the plot goes completely off the rails at certain points of the film , i do n't know what the hell the director was thinking when for no reason at all , a 7 year old black kid who we 've never met before takes the main character out of the abbey and starts cartwheeling in front of her . yes , that 's right , cartwheeling . nonsense of this kind is occasionally interrupted by catherines " fantasies " in which she is being carried around a cathedral by an ogre.<br /><br />northanger abbey is basically visual euthanasia so if you want to murder your boss or something like that , bbc have basically discovered a new way to kill someone . northanger is a barely laughably bad film . do n't watch it unless you 're in a padded cell .
1 a three stooges short , this one featuring shemp . of all those involving shemp i 've seen , this is my favorite performance by him in a stooges short . the basic plot is that shemp must get married by 6 o'clock that very evening if he 's to inherit the half a million dollars a rich uncle left him in his will . so shemp sets out to get himself a bride but finds it a tougher road than expected , that is until they learn of his inheritance money . best bits here involve shemp shaving , shemp and moe in a telephone booth and larry on piano as accompaniment to shemp 's voice - training session . also the sequence where shemp is mistaken as cousin basil and its outcome proves hilarious .
0 all movies that contain " goofy sound effects " should be shot . if there is one thing i hate , it 's got ta be the use of a " whoop whoop whoo " when somebody gets hit one the head . the only movies i have seen to do this is ghoulies iv and hobgoblins when they are in the bar , and pixie is hitting the guy in the red suit with a beer bottle ... or rather , fanning him with a beer bottle , because she never really hits him with it . yes ghoulies iv does suck . but i have to wonder , did they mean to not make the so called " ghoulies " mouths move when they supposedly talked ? their faces are almost as static as the masks used in trolls 2 . hell , i can make a better mask out of construction paper , some rubber cement and a handful of glitter . this sucked .
1 this is a movie that deserves another look -- if you have n't seen it for a while , or a first look -- if you were too young when it came out ( 1983 ) . based on a play by the same name , it is the story of an older actor who heads a touring shakespearean repertory company in england during world war ii . it deals with his stress of trying to perform a shakespeare each night while facing problems such as bombed theaters and a company made up of older or physically handicapped actors -- the young , able bodied ones being taken for military service . it also deals with his relationship with various members of his company , especially with his dresser . so far it all sounds rather dull but nothing could be further from the truth . while tragic overall , the story is told with a lot of humor and emotions run high throughout . the two male leads both received oscar nominations for best actor and deservedly so . i strongly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys human drama , theater -- especially shakespeare , or who has ever worked backstage in any capacity . the backstage goings - on make up another facet of the movie that will be fascinating to most viewers .
1 spoilers in this review ! despite a few highly improbable scenes , including the boys in pe measuring their penises in a contest and the few obligatory teens - trying - to - get - laid vignettes , this movie captures the painful essence of high school in ways that few teen films have ever done . it achieves this by not only showing the trio of friends , gary , dave , rick , as smoking , drinking , ever on the prowl teens , but also dwells on the nature of friendship itself as these three friends have their loyalties tested . this film is a snapshot of the time when childhood ends . for the shy romantic gary , when he sees the lovely karen for the first time he falls instantly in love . the awakening emotion in gary is writ large on the screen , and he proves his love for her by taking her in when she is jilted by her lover . this love for karen signals the end of gary 's innocence , as the bonds with his two best friends will be tested , and broken , over the course of the story . the confident ladies man , rick , is the person in high school we all secretly wish we were : handsome , cool , and always has the impossibly beautiful girls in a swoon . rick turns out to be a cad , but you have to bear in mind that his character is only 17 years old . he panics and makes a bad decision . from rick 's perspective , the story is also about finding the one girl of his dreams , a bad breakup , and then at the end reconciling . the look on rick 's face as gary walks in and sees karen kissing rick , shows that he at last understands that his best friend and he love the same woman . as in real life , you do n't bow out because your friend has an unrequited love . this is the tragedy of the film . rick is no villain , and constantly through the film he reminds gary and dave that they 're his best friends . the soulful quality of gary 's performance , however , is the heart of the story . lawrence monoson is a beautiful loser . he does everything right , his heart 's in the right place , and he 's consumed by love for karen . yet , karen , in the end , is not moved by gary 's devotion and kindness . karen represents all the people in the world who take in without giving back , who exist in a vacuum of their own ego and never stop to realize the emotional damage and trauma they inflict on others . this film is brutal in its statements on love and friendship , but that 's what makes it unique among teen films . it ceases being a comedy and becomes a hopelessly romantic film , albeit one doomed to a tragic conclusion . anyone who has ever found the girl of his dreams and did not win her , will understand . the heartrending crushes of high school are every bit as real as the emotional strains of adulthood , and this film will remind you of that in bold strokes . gary 's final reversal , as he drives away with the inscribed locket , is as poignant a moment as any in cinema . one feels , after watching this , that it 's really made of two movies . the first part is a silly teen sexploitation film , and once the story begins , it 's a strongly affecting drama . a terrific movie . it should also be noted that the soundtrack was prescient in its selection of many rising stars including the police , the cars , devo , oingo boingo , the plimsouls , the waitresses , gleaming spires , and phil seymour .
1 who said it had to be believable ? do yourself a favor and turn off your ration before you sit down to view this film . you 'll enjoy the experience much more . you 'll find yourself forgiving some of the movie 's more outlandish plot set - ups , and simply accepting it for what it is -- a great family film . i appreciated not having to be concerned about " questionable elements " in a children 's film for once . that , to me , is worth the price of the ticket . and it manages to maintain its wholesomeness without being obvious about it -- older chidlren will enjoy this film . enough good humor to keep adults interested . very good film .
0 if ever there was a film that can be considered a missed opportunity then that film is galaxina . what could possibly be wrong in basing a sci - fi film around a sexy statuesque female android ? surely such a film could never be a complete waste of time ? well , sadly this movie is pretty close to useless . there are a number of faults with this production it has to be said , however , there are two basic problems that entirely destroy the whole enterprise . firstly , this is a comedy with no funny bits at all , or at the very least a film where the potentially amusing aspects are presented in an incredibly unamusing way . secondly , the title character is woefully underused . this may be because dorothy stratten was not really an actress but if so it was a terrible decision as she is still easily the best thing about the film . i do n't think she really needed to be a great thespian to pull off the role of a sexy android to be perfectly honest . anyway , what we are left with is a whole lot of mind - numbing comedy relief , which often is made up of hopeless spoof - type gags of the big sci - fi hits of the time such as alien , star wars and 2001 . it 's badly written and not funny at all , and it does n't even really have a plot to propel things along . the story basically is about a police space - cruiser that is sent to get a rock . that 's it ! steven spielberg once said that a high - concept movie was one whose plot line could be described in one sentence . what he did n't define was what you call a movie that can be described in less than a sentence - pointless maybe?<br /><br />this seemed like a sure - fire winner to me but it failed miserably . it seems to have been an attempt to spoof star wars and combine it with adult comedy situations . all it does actually achieve is to leave you cold and a little irritated that it was n't close to what it should 've been . a barbarella for the 80 's this ain't.<br /><br />shortly after this film was finished dorothy stratten was murdered in an appallingly violent and horrific way . and for that reason galaxina has derived a considerable amount of it 's cult interest . i just think it 's a great shame that dorothy did n't have a better film left to immortalise her .
1 it is to typical of people complaining about something when they no nothing about it ... so this is about a gay man falling for a straight women . first of all ... this is a true story so you ca nt say its not believable second its written by a gay man so the whole thing about this being against the gays are just plain stupid . personally i think this was the best love story i 've ever seen . and i am very pro gay . i think this shows that real love is about personality not just looks and sex . and it has nothing against anyone who is gay , straight or bi unlike so many other shows . maybe we in europe take to it more cus most tv here are a bit deeper and make you think more then american tv ... plus we do n't fear when it comes to showing certain things.<br /><br />if you want something funny with one of englands best ( lesley sharp ) and you want to see a decent believable love story without too much sap this is for you . i know i love it
1 pity the poor reviewer who disliked / did n't understand this wonderful film . what a sad life he must lead!<br /><br />this movie has more to say about life and relationships than most i 've ever seen , yet it 's not dark or preachy like the " ordinary people " type of film . it is mostly humorous , though not technically a comedy.<br /><br />the whole thing feels a little like a fantasy , perhaps shakespear 's " midsummer nights ' dream . " beautiful , intelligent women abound , with wonderful cinematography and a non - insulting screenplay that does n't miss a beat.<br /><br />i look forward to seeing it every time this film is re - run on cable . it 's like re - reading a favorite , treasured book .
0 this movie was pure genius . john waters is brilliant . it is hilarious and i am not sick of it even after seeing it about 20 times since i bought it a few months ago . the acting is great , although ricki lake could have been better . and johnny depp is magnificent . he is such a beautiful man and a very talented actor . and seeing most of johnny 's movies , this is probably my favorite . i give it 9.5/10 . rent it today !
1 this 1955 producers ' showcase version of the musical peter pan with mary martin has the benefit of showcasing most of the original broadway cast , including kathleen nolan as wendy , who was more natural an actress than the girl they hired for the 1960 color televised play . it 's a shame that most people wo n't sit through anything black and white anymore because in many respects this earlier production - which does n't even show up in the imdb listings when you put " peter pan " into the search engine ! - is superior to the cutesier color version most people have watched . i obtained the original on disc and then did work on it to make it look and sound better digitally . now when i put the 1960 color version on it looks garish in comparison . i suspect mary martin herself no doubt preferred this original 1955 b / w producers ' showcase televised version.<br /><br />as an added plus the disc i got also showed the original commercials and opening promo . how far away the 1950 's seem now - such an innocent time compared to today . i miss it .
0 from the dire special effects onwards i was absolutely gob smacked at how bad anyone can make a film . lets put it this way , i have absolutely no directing experience whatsoever and for the first time ever when watching a film i thought ' i can do better than that ! whilst sat watching this pap . the acting in this film was terrible , i suppose the best actor was the guy from lawnmower man but the french guy from aliens3 was so wooden i wondered how he got the former job in the first place . the storyline was mediocre and i suppose , like most films , if the rest had been done well it would have stood up . i do n't usually write reviews here but after seeing a couple of people gave this film a good rating ( must be cast / crew ) i felt i had to say my piece to save anyone from accidentally hiring it or wasting their money on buying this cack .
0 a romp across a disbelieving outback , this outragous adventure enchants through it 's downright brazeness . comedy from the clashing confrontation of cultural assumptions - as drama from crisis . perhaps a little too queenie for some - i would love to have watched in a cinema audience in the outback . shockingly good
1 this is a sort of hidden gem . it has little to no promotion , no fanfare , no classic status , and it deserves all of the above ! one of the great directors of cinema , fritz lang , has created a real gem in this excellent western . a fine cast led by randolph scott ( in probably one of his greatest performances ) , the always sturdy dean jagger , robert young as a surprisingly accomplished dude plus many veteran character actors : chill wills , slim summerville , john carradine , barton maclane and others in an exciting zane grey story of the laying of the western union cable across country . it has tense drama , sprinklings of humor and great effects . it 's reminiscent of demille in ways and yet fritz lang leaves his own stamp on it . at very least this is a damned good western !
0 critics have started calling it the oscar winner club , understandably . what after halle berry won it for monsters ball then going straight to the diabolical catwoman . hilary swank triumphs in boys do n't cry and follows it with the core . jamie foxx takes a nosedive as a pilot in the dull stealth after scooping a gong for ray . now it 's seems hollywood starlet charlize theron craps all over her " monster " oscar with this one of the worst sci - fi spectacles ever made.<br /><br />the film loses its audience interest after a mere 20 minutes meaning the only thing really worth staying for is the fact that despite the film being rubbish charlize theron is still an exceptional actress who is clearly making the best of a crude and laughable premise . not only is √¶on flux ultimately shallow but for an action flick it 's also really very dull . it will only really appeal to comic book fans and horney teenagers who like the idea of theron running around half naked for 90 minutes . flux only really succeed in failing.<br /><br />set against the 2011 virus that kills 99 % of the world 's populace , and in the last city on earth , bregna , the survivors , some four hundred years later , in the year 2415 , are continuing to live in the goodchild dynasty , the name of the scientist who developed its cure.<br /><br />all is not well in this utopia and it is not what lies beyond its high walls that protects its citizens from the never ending jungle but what unspoken , unwritten taboo that holds and binds these unwritten taboo that holds and binds these unfortunates ' together that lies within these walls of paranoia , conformity and unquestionable obedience . filmed in and around berlin , ironically , this is a story set against a totalitarian state , a walled city , where its peoples are no longer capable of reproducing , and its sinister and most secret plot of how it sustains life.<br /><br />√¶on flux is the assassin that has been assigned by the underground rebels to change the course of mankind , forever . this is the story of her fight for justice , freedom and revenge.<br /><br />√¶on flux combined lousy narratives , ropy pacing and truly dire effects . looking more like an unrealistic video game rather than a film . the only thing that is fortunate about the failure is that no sequels are in the works , flux might just be the beginning and the end of what could have been one of the worst franchises in history , thank god for the lousy box office takings then.<br /><br />my final verdict on this truly lousy feature ? there really is n't a story here just charlize theron jumping around in a black suit like a grass hopper . the acting is very wooden moronic and emotionless compared to the other cinemas that are out there today . it try 's too much to be like an adaption and does n't really take much from the cartoon which is what i was expecting , the only thing that was done half right that pays tribute to the cartoon was the fly in the eye scene . avoid at all costs .
0 worse than mediocre thriller about an abused wife who goes on the lam after she is linked circumstantially to the death of her husband and sister . determined to prove that her husband is alive she follows leads across the state , her peril increasing at each stop . chasing after her are the traditional ' good - cop ' and ' bad - cop ' pair of partners . one is convinced of her innocence the other more interested in closing the case and getting home . this pair is often able to corner their suspect but never quite to capture her . all the main players meet up in a remote town in the desert and the truth begins to unfold with deadly consequences for some.<br /><br />wow ! this was a bad movie . the lead acted as if she was tranquilized , the cops could n't find a suspect if he or she is in the police station ( this happens twice ) and everyone else is as one - dimensional as can be . avoid this one at all costs.<br /><br / >
0 i am pretty surprised to see that this movie earned even lukewarm reviews , i found this movie downright awful . the plot flounders around trying to decide if it is a comedy or a thriller , then realizes it can not achieve either . so it throws in the towel and continues with its absurd plot highlighted with a unintentional hilarious scene with laura linney , an injection , and spilled coffee that leaves the audience awkwardly squirming in their seats looking at one another like is this for real ? basically it is abysmal and really disappointing for robin williams fans , and it makes you think someone blackmailed laura linney into adding this piece of trash to her otherwise respectable resume . i wanted to leave after 10 minutes and wish i had , even seeing it for free i wanted someone to pay me for my wasted time . the computer glitch / twist in this movie was embarrassingly stupid , and by the end you do n't care who wins the election . i vote for straight to dvd .
1 * * 1/2 elisha cuthbert , chad michael murray , brian van holt , paris hilton and jon abrahams . directed by jaume collet - serra.<br /><br />yet another classic horror film remade with dunder - headed teenage acting despite grizzly and creative deaths . based on the 1953 vincent price film house of wax where a maniac kills unsuspecting teenage hooligans and turns them into priceless wax figures . still with the fantastic set design to make the whole house into wax the movie is a typical classic horror remake like tobe hooper 's 1974 classic texas chainsaw massacre later remade , despite creativity and so - so acting the movie was still just a gore picture . director serra showed mild enthusiasm with his directing but still worth watching . my final rating 7/10 .
1 what some hollywood - movies try and practically never succeed , creating somehow metaphysical connections between persons ( without becoming unrealistic ) , manages this beautiful movie perfectly well ( resembling in that way a little to the wonderful ' la double vie de veronique ' of the same director and with the same beautiful actress ) . this is a real movie , that changes perspective of life a little bit - intelligent and beautiful story , masterfully directed , excellent main actors , masterful cinematography . i 've just seen the movie the 3rd or 4th time , and i still think it 's one of the best i 've ever seen . and if you should be unhappy with the ending of ' white ' - ' red ' puts an happy end to the whole trilogy .
0 i 'm shocked that all the " hated it " ratings are sixes and sevens , still above average . to me , this seems a case of " the emperor has no clothes " . i understand this film was produced on a very low budget in the early 70's ... regardless , it became a struggle to sit through and watch . the dvd i saw did have some subtitles , but about 75 % of the speech is not subtitled . some of it is hard to understand . the jamaican patois was cool to hear , but you struggle not to ' tune out ' after awhile . some of the shots were nice , and the realism was there , even if some of the performances were not great.(jimmy cliff did a good job ) the plot is not bad , but quite predictable . in the 1:43 film , the highlights are jimmy cliff(ivan ) singing for a scene , and a couple of shoot - outs and a fight . probably 15 minutes or so . the rest is pretty boring . btw , near the beginning of the film , there are some weird cuts with the ivan character that seem like a editing mistake , which made me laugh for a bit . one reviewer said this film has been cut so many times , that there are few copies of the original 1972 theatrical version out there . the ending was kind of interesting , showing how the media from a young age influences people , it could also be a general comment on the white man's / colonialism 's influence on jamaica . other main themes are poverty , corruption , church , ambition ... in closing , the soundtrack is definitely worthwhile , the film much less .
1 affable aspiring cartoonist hoops mccann ( a wonderfully engaging performance by john cusack ) and his best buddy george ( the deliciously deadpan joel murray ) go to nantucket for the summer following graduation from high school . hoops , george , and several newfound pals come to the aid of cassandra ( demi moore at her most charming ) , a singer who 's family house is being threatened with demolition by the greedy beckersted clan . writer / director savage steve holland offers an often hilariously wacky and zesty nonstop barrage of admittedly broad and dumb , but still very funny jokes . the constant madcap lunacy has a real giddy , good - natured and infectiously inane vitality to it that 's impossible to either dislike or resist . moreover , the lively and enthusiastic acting from a fine game cast adds immensely to the zany merriment : bobcat goldthwait as the spastic egg stork , tom villard as his goofy brother clay , curtis armstrong as the sweet ack ack raymond , mark metcalf as evil rich jerk aquilla beckersted , matt mulhern as the mean teddy , kimberly foster as the fetching cookie , joe flaherty as the gung - ho general raymond , william hickey as cranky old man beckersted , jeremy piven as smug preppy bully ty , and john matuszak as hulking biker stan . isidore mankofsky 's slick cinematography , the hip thrashy soundtrack , cory lerios ' cool rockin ' score , and the funky animation are all uniformly excellent . single funniest scene : egg in a godzilla suit terrorizing a posh dinner party . an absolute hoot .
0 i mean really , really , really high and this movie has a shot at entertainment . i do n't mean regular high , i mean the high where reading the phonebook would have you in stitches . otherwise save the time out of your life and go do something more constructive with it , like hitting your head on a brick wall and insulting your own intelligence . a complete waste of talent in some cases ( bernie mac , john c. mcginley , tom kenny , and the master of hams shatner ) and exactly the kind of crap they deserve to make ( the myriad of rappers who insist on making movies ) . not without it 's laughs ( again chemical aid is crucial ) and certainly not without offending the politically over - sensitive ( which i 'm always in favor of ) but ultimately not worth the time out of your life .
0 i just saw this movie and all i can say is , where are the drive in 's these days . this seems like it would have been a great 2nd feature at a drive in in 1977 ( maybe playing with one of those joan collins movies ) , but it 's only worth watching now if you 're feeling nostalgic for the 70 's . silly plot that is full of holes , but it does remind one of the era it was made in . interesting to see melanie griffith so young and anne lockhart is quite attractive , though not much of an actress . in fact , there is not much acting going on in this movie at all . it 's sort of a dukes of hazzard adventure without a twang or a 1969 dodge charger jumping over stuff in the woods . but there is a mecrury comet jumping over a garbage dump in this one !
0 why bother , itv ? admittedly , mansfield park is the most difficult of the novels to " get , " and fanny is certainly the hardest to like , but ... if one is going to take it on , then have the courage to risk being true to the book and its rather complicated spirit . and for heaven 's sake , have the guts to cast fanny as she was written : a prissy , good - hearted , sweetish , whiner ! mrs. norris was n't nearly as awful as she should have been . and what the heck happened to portsmouth ? the contrast between fanny 's rather dubious family and family home and the splendors of mansfield is key to , well , so many aspects of fanny 's refusal of henry , her uncle 's rejection , henry 's near transformation to a good person , etc . , etc . again , given the complexity and challenges of the novel , why did they bother ? it 's beyond me ...
0 if i could give this excuse for a film a 0 or negative rating i would . i was stupid enough to pick this dvd up in the shop , read the blurb and think , that sounds quite good , i 'll spend ¬£ 10 and buy it . all i got at the end of it was a ¬£ 10 coaster . absolutely awful , i do n't even know where to begin . i have no idea why anyone has given this more than 2 stars because i ca n't think of one good thing to say about it . < br /><br />the plot is basically , 7 people go into an unexplored cave , one of them is a reporter . no - one else knows they are there . when they get in the cave , they ca n't get out and they get killed off one by one by a monster . there turns out to be no reason for the reporter . one of the characters has some past demons where his ex girlfriend drowns in a cave 2 years ago ... there seems to be no relevance or reason for that either , just a rubbish attempt at character building i assume ? anyway , the monster turns out to be a guy that wandered into the cave as a normal little kid and has lived in there all his life . this for no reason makes him superhuman , able to glow , see in the dark , take bullets , breathe underwater , be in 2 places at once and have insane strength ( able to move boulders , carry grown men as dead weight , etc ) . < br /><br />in the end scene there are 2 women left alive , they wake up naked , just covered in some bit of rug or something . they then find a picture of a kid . the monster then bursts in the door , wrapped in a carpet with some sort of animal skull over his head ( says in the directors commentary it was a crow 's skull , if so that would be the frekin biggest crow i have seen in my life ) and quite literally goes " raaahhh " like a kiddie on halloween . i was watching it with my boyfriend and at that point he literally burst out laughing . the guy then sees a picture of himself as a kid and has a flashback to him sitting under a tree with his face all burnt and then getting up and wandering into the cave . that is the extent of the back story to why he mutilates people and it leaves you feeling a bit cheated for a story . the monster then kills one of the women and brutally rapes the other one , cut to end credits . i know the rape scene was designed to be shocking , but as a woman it just made me feel quite ill and was the thing that affected me the most in the whole film . he could have killed her and cut her into pieces and ate her and it would have been less horrific than the rape scene.<br /><br />there are so many things that are left unanswered at the end . aside from all this , the scenes where there was minutes at a time of just black and nothing else was annoying and the constant nauseating camera angles where it 's all upside down and you ca n't see what 's going on wound me up so much at one point i almost turned it off . an absolutely terrible film . you might as well get the money you were going to spend on it and set fire to it , it would be money better spent , as like some clever person posting above me said , once you 've watched it , you ca n't un watch it .
1 i like movies about quirky people . " one flew over the cuckoo 's nest " is maybe my all time favorite , so one can imagine i had a blast with this one . it 's definitely not one to watch if you want to walk off smiling . this movie is unpredictable and intense . some scenes are downright frightening , even after multiple viewings ( because this kind of stuff really can happen ) . it will most definitely keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole ride . and after you see the ending , if you 're not deeply disturbed , you really should check yourself for a pulse.<br /><br />the acting was phenomenal . marcy , with her rather extreme case of tourette 's , shifts from quirky - cute to utterly terrifying , sometimes appearing so out - of - control that she looks like the undead . seth was great , too . the focus of the movie definitely does not fall nearly as much on him as it does on marcy , though he happens to be the one that gains the most momentum as a blossoming character.<br /><br />it 's a classic love story with some unconventional twists , and it 's also my favorite love story next to " true romance . " there are two bad reviews for it up here , but one of the people who gave such a review did n't have his facts straight and admitted to not seeing the whole film , while the other was just looking for some hollywood thrills without the deep characters ( and perhaps was a little thrown off by the apparent shallowness of the plot , seeing as the end goal revolves around stealing a black bobbi head from a toy store ) . the point is that this movie is not for those who want to see something " normal " or " lighthearted " . this one is messed up and indie as can be , and wo n't let you go until the heavy climax .
0 this movie had a very convoluted plot and very contrived setting , that i , frankly , could not follow , which is surprising considering the acting and dialogue could have only been the product of a kindergartener 's writing . if you like kathy ireland , then maybe you 'd want to see this . the movie was probably made as a vehicle to try to get her into hollywood , but if that was its goal i would have to say that i hope she did n't invest too much money in its production .
0 piece of junk , would 've given it a 0 if i could have . animation is good , but not quite good enough . storyline is absolutely the most ridiculous i 've ever come across , and that 's saying a lot ! this ' movie ' tried so hard to be interesting , but failed miserably . it 's almost as if the writer started one story , then got another idea , and attempted to mesh the two together . do n't waste your time on this ; believe me , you 'll be as ticked off with yourself as i was . the only actor of any note in this was james woods , and his part was peripheral at best . i 'm all for doing stuff that is edgy , that pushes the envelopes , but this simply did n't cut it .
0 i thought " puppets making crank phone calls " was pretty low , but i do n't believe that carlos mencia 's show even qualifies as comedy . his main objective is to make the audience incredibly uncomfortable while using the word " beaner " as many times as he possible can . i have never felt compelled to write a review declaring the awfulness of anything on imdb before , but i really do hope this show is never renewed or rerun.<br /><br />mencia is trying to be the next dave chapelle , and perhaps he was only hired by the network because they hoped he would fill those shoes . it is obvious right down to the rip of chapelle 's intro ( blues guys vs. mariachi band ) . however , mencia has absolutely * no * attitude , and does not delve into popular views of the hispanic culture enough to come up with a creative poke at it each time . instead he sticks to a small number of hardly - shocking nicknames for his fellow latinos and makes " jokes " about immigration . every once in a while , he 'll take advantage of the slight darkness of his skin to make fun of someone else , like middle eastern cultures . these jokes mainly consist of reiterating every joke or stereotype made against the culture , and perhaps some incredibly old topics ( such as 9/11 ) , in a watered down , stand - up style , while he laughs at himself to cover up the audience 's style . i think he 's too afraid of really offending anyone , so it just makes the viewer feel awkward . he also beats jokes to death . if you 've ever seen " why the f * * * is this news ? " you 'll know what i 'm talking about . it 's funny at first , but he just rambles on and on and becomes captain obvious at some point . < br /><br />it 's a trainwreck that is purely painful to watch .
0 irvine welsh 's follow up to trainspotting hits the screen as three short stories set in edinburgh , all with a few of welsh 's trade marks , drug culture , depression , the working class and hibernian football club . uneasy to watch in places , it is no less than very well written , 2 of the stories having a darkly comic twist to them while the 2nd story a serious ( and shockingly realistic ) plot to it . will not appeal to most , including myself to a point , but will no doubt adopt a cult following .
1 the first time i saw " alice in wonderland ¬ñ an x - rated musical comedy " , was in the early ' 80 in a movie - theater in n.y. city with some friends . i remember we actually enjoyed it very much , although we were left wondering why all the " goodies " were covered by in various forms shaped colored patches and why the movie was suddenly jumping from one scene to the next one , leaving us guessing ... what we just missed . obviously it was the soft - core edited ( chopped ) version , which left me with the desire to watch it again soon , but in its original integral version . well , more then 20 years went by , during which i forgot all about this movie and , only a few days ago , by sheer chance , i stumbled upon a heavily used vhs copy ( which had seen better times : a bit washed - out colors , scratchy sound and a few flaws ) , but guess what ? it 's the original uncut version and , this time , i really had a ball ! humor , musical and porn may sound an awkward combination but , in this case , it really works and , unlikely the big majority of boring porn - flicks nowadays invading our screens , this is a really amusing and entertaining sex fantasy , which will not disappoint you . the direction is clever , the swift editing makes the movie fly like a bird , all the familiar characters are lovable or just plain funny , all the actors seem having a good time , the songs are catchy ( worth mentioning the one about " growing up " sung by alice at the beginning of the movie and the hilarious " what 's a nice girl like you doing on a knight like this " ) , the dance numbers are well choreographed and staged ( amazingly energetic terry hall proves that she can " also " dance and dances enthusiastically her guts away ... don't worry , she also does what she was best known for ... ) , the acting , the singing , the set , the costumes are of quality level and then ... there is kristine " blue eyes " debell , in the first starring role of her career and ( oh boy ! ) she indeed has a few h.c. sequences ! personally i think they are absolutely not distasteful , on the contrary , they are spontaneous and quite arousing . she is young and ( ohhh ! ) so very pretty ; with the help of her new friends in wonderland , she discovers her body and her sexuality so , she sings , she dances and ... what do you expect ? she is also experimenting sex ! the closing sequence , when she finally makes love to her boy - friend , is exceptionally well photographed and directed and is the highlight of the movie . i think her " physique du role " ( the innocent blue eyes and captivating smile ) and her acting ability , make those explicit sequences more then acceptable and actually highly enjoyable . there is plenty of sex going on in ( this ) wonderland and everybody seems eager to " get busy " with the first available boy(s ) or girl(s ) , which means lot of hard - core action to be seen . on the other hand , some close - up shots , clearly " spliced in " , just to make the " porn - hounds " really happy , are a bit redundant for my personal taste . in general , however , the sex - action is not offensive since handled with a great deal of humor and it blends almost seamlessly with the music , the dances and the comedy . if you think you and your partner can handle graphic sex , watch it together . take my word , you will have an hour and a half of very good time ( perhaps also an after - show extra action ... ) this is " adult entertainment " so be careful , do n't leave this video around or among other kid 's videos . if your 10 years old can put his hands on it , he might amuse himself , but you will be forced to provide embarrassing explanations about the reasons why " this " alice behaves quite differently from the one he red about in lewis carroll novel or he watched on the disney 's video . i bet , you will not forget this " one - of - a - kind " very soon . it 's a real shame that they do n't mak'em like that anymore ... ! i give it a 9 out of 10 .
1 this episode introduces us to the formal dress uniforms worn here by captain picard , commander riker , and lieutenant tasha yar . the plot of this episode deals with 2 groups of separate alien delegates , the anticans and the selae who try to capture and eat each other at every turn . the 2 sides really hate each other , and it is up to riker and tasha to contain them and keep them out of trouble.<br /><br />meanwhile a mysterious spacial anomaly goes around the ship injuring and killing a few of the crew members . but at the end of the episode this same spacial anomaly possesses a valuable member of the crowd . will they be able to rescue him so that they maybe able to continue on with their on going mission of space exploration ? < br /><br />note : this episode marks irish actor colm meaney 's second appearance on tng after " encounter at farpoint .

1 shawn michaels vs. edge-8- kind of hard to believe shawn michaels is in the opening match but still a great match by both men , edge , whether you like or not is a great performer in the ring , and shawn michaels is just ageless when it comes to his performance the undertaker vs. heidenreich . casket match-2- ok , after a good opening match , now this , what a crappy match . undertaker has given some great matches at the royal rumble , and 1998 's royal rumble against shawn michaels was the same type of match , but this is way worse then that match.<br /><br />kurt angle vs. big show vs. bradshaw . triple threat wwe championship-6- it 's alright , i feel all three men could of given a better performance , this just really did n't show them at their best.<br /><br />randy orton vs. triple h. world heavyweight championship-9- triple h gets a clean win , can you believe it , sure he takes out the sledgehammer but does n't use it . randy orton did great when acting like he got a concussion , but how he got the concussion is really ridiculous . i really liked this match , this was the best performance i 've seen from hhh in forever.<br /><br />the royal rumble match-7- this was highly entertaining and i usually do n't score the royal rumble match this high . the winner is again , very predictable , but just this had a lot of moments that were very entertaining to watch the segments with flair and guerrero are hilarious the best segments i 've seen in a while.<br /><br />overall , this is a great ppv and a must own for wrestling fans .
0 a stunningly beautiful charlotte lewis stars as a woman who is terrorized by a ghosts who torment her on the phone . driven to the edge in terror charlotte is forced to confront this chilling mystery in order to save her sanity and her life . i ca n't believe that ruggero deodato , the director behind " ultimo mondo cannibale","cannibal holocaust " and " house on the edge of the park " directed this absurd piece of trash . admittedly the music by goblin front man claudio simonetti is pretty good , but the story is painfully stupid . the script by franco ferrini is ridiculous and it makes no sense , the acting is bad and there is absolutely no suspense . the scene in which a prospective rapist of charlotte lewis is killed by coins ejected from a subway telephone is more than laughable . don't waste your time with this piece of crap . there are far better italian horror movies out there !
1 john has made two one man shows . spic o rama and freaks , and neither one has shown up on dvd ... john ! ! ! why do you this to me john ? ? put it on dvd john , so the people can see , they need to see john ! ! :d ... just in case anyones keeping a watchful aye ! !
0 the film has no connection with the real life in bosnia in those days . should be more realistic and shows the viewer real traumas that were happening to common people during the war . please see some films of yugoslav authors ( emir kusturica , ljubisa samardzic, ... e.g . bure baruta ( a barrel of powder ) , tito i ja ( tito and me ) , lepa sela lepo gore ( beautiful villages burn beautiful ) , etc ... just this is the real way to know about so called bosnian problem . hollywood is definitive not th right address to make films about the balcan peninsula . maybe vietnam , ww ii , ... but not of the slavs living in former yugoslavia .
1 i do n't play video games at all but my children do.<br /><br />i got a big kick out of this . would like to see more of this type of film . " very cool " as my youngest would say.<br /><br />interesting characters and the overall story line was interesting . like i said i do n't play video games but i think that my children would enjoyed this . it was not full of bad language and that is a pleasant change . this visual concept was different which caught my eye . plus the sound track was pretty good . i might even try out some of the games my sons plays to see because of this film . who knows maybe i 'll be a gamer someday .
0 the film successfully gives a graphic portrayal of the suffering of forced sex labour , but nothing more . the leftest agenda behind this movie could be seen a mile away and leaves viewer so embarrassed while watching if you know that feeling . so , the women are kidnapped and sent to ex yugoslavian territory to work as sex slaves because ( take a deep breath ) the american military institution is corrupt and looks away while their private security contractors are selling people abroad . you do n't need half a brain to see the relevance to iraq war and black water company.<br /><br />what a load of leftest excrement ! looks like i have been fooled all my life into thinking that this problem and many others were a direct result of communism 's grip on this region for 45 years . but no , it was the american war on iraq , which is also responsible for earthquakes , tropical storms , and the constipation i had last week.<br /><br />the film ignores the fact that 95 % of the sex trade is women willing to sell their bodies for money and entry to the western block . you also see scenes that are so stupid you want to pull your hair . we have someone chasing down a woman in the streets of london in broad daylight , beat her up , then somehow drags her unconscious body half a mile back to the apartment where he rapes her . no one sees this or calls the police , and the running woman does not care to scream during the chase . even better , we later see 4 - 5 women lined up in the centre of london in -again- broad daylight to be sold , one of them has a smashed face , and people are shopping in the background as if nothing was happening . you ca n't make this stupidity up.<br /><br />i used to think that such trash was exclusive to hollywood , but apparently i was mistaken .
0 this movie seems a little clunky around the edges , like not quite enough zaniness was thrown it when it should have been . but i mostly enjoyed it.<br /><br />the storyline is more than a little bit preposterous , so no expectation of " something real " should be included in your viewing experience . check your brain in at the door . it will not be needed and might be an impediment otherwise.<br /><br />i quite enjoyed clennon 's performance as the real dr. baird . his role was spot on for giving aykroyd 's character a protagonist . what a putz the real dr. baird was.<br /><br />and matthau was quite good as the lead character 's sidekick . annoying at first , but ultimately lovable . sort of . kind of . or at least something the use of a bar of soap and a lot of water would have been more than helpful.<br /><br />actually worth watching ? if you 're in the mood for a spoof on the psychiatric profession , sure , why not .
